# Chat_App
This is a simple chat app that I built as a part of Rust learning process.

There are 2 endpoints
    - send message
    - receive message

I used EventStream and tokio primarily to receive and broadcast the message respectively. 
The chat app contains channels which broadcasts the message to the subscribers.


Thanks to Let's Get Rusty youtube channel for walking through the basics.

Backend - Rust
Frontend - JavaScript,HTML,CSS
